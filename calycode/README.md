## ‼️Manifest

I believe developer tools should empower teams with clarity, transparency, and control—not guesswork. That's why [@calycode/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@calycode/cli) was born.
We build open, reliable, and automated workflows for Xano, prioritizing reproducibility and human oversight.
Our mission is to make backend development safe, collaborative, and future-ready—so every team can ship confidently, own their code, and never lose sight of what matters most: trust in the process.
